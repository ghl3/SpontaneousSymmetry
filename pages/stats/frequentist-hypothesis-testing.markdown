# Scenario 1: Comparing a model to data


We will discuss the seemingly straightforward scenario of having a model and a dataset and asking whether the data is "consistent" with the model.  Depending on one's philosophy, there are a number of ways to think about what "consistent" means in concrete mathematical terms.

The classical frequentist way of answering this question was pioneered by Fischer and is based on a calculated quantity known as the "p-value".  Given a model and a dataset, the p-value is defined as the probability of that model generating that dataset OR generating a dataset "more extreme" than the measured dataset.  The logical underpinning of this calculation is answer the question, "Is my data so rare given my model that I should reject my model?".  If the model is very likely to generate the given dataset, or i it is likely to generate data that is even more "extreme", then one intuitively should not reject the model based on the measured data.  If I flip a coin and get 2 heads in a row, but I know that the odds of getting even 3 heads in a row given a fair coin aren't SO low, then I shouldn't conclude that my coin isn't fair.  If I roll a dice and get 2 1's in a row, but I know that the total probability of getting the any number twice in a row isn't so low, then I shouldn't conclude that my dice is somehow faulty.

It is clear how to calculate the probability of the measured dataset given the model, but it remains to be defined what hypothetical datasets should be included in the set of "more extreme" data.  This definition may vary depending on the problem.  These definitions of "extreme" may include:

- Any dataset that is equally likely or less likely than the measured dataset
- In the case of 1-d data, any value that is less likely than the measured data and is on the same side relative to the mode of the distribution as the measured data (one-sided p-value).
- Any dataset having some chosen summary statistic whose probability is less than or equal to the value of the summary statistic calculated on the observed data

There are numerous other ways, and choosing a good definition of more extreme data is an important part of conducting a good model comparison.  It depends on the problem and the statistical argument that one is attempting to make.

I'll emphasize that this procedure is merely a heuristic.  It is meant to be a check that should be considered when comparing data and a model.  It should not be interpreted religiously and has little meaning outside of its definition.  

Given the definition of a p-value, a typical p-value test consists of the following steps:

- Determine in advance a p-value threshold that will be used to conclude if the model and data are consistent or not.  A typical values is 0.05 (5%).
- Measure your data and calculate the p-value using the model
- If the p-value is < the threshold value, then conclude that the data and model are inconsistent.  If not, maintain belief that they are consistent.

<!--
Having run an experiment and obtained a dataset, the probability of measuring that data or data that is "more extreme" GIVEN THAT the null hypothesis is true is known as the "p-value".  For this to make sense, one needs a definition of what "more extreme means".  For now, let's assume that we have a definition of the extremeness of data.

A p-value test, not surprisingly, consists of running an experiment, calculating the p-value, and compares that p-value to some predetermined threshold.  If the p-value is less than that threshold, one rejects the null hypothesis (and is therefore forced to accept the alternate hypothesis since we initially agreed that there are only two possible hypotheses).  If not, then one maintains belief in the null hypothesis.
-->

<!--
A p-value test can be thought of as a subset of the general hypothesis testing framework above: it is a means of diving the space of data into regions that support $H_0$ and complementary regions that support $H_1$.  In this test, the summary statistic of the data is the p-value itself: we associate each possible data value with its p-value and those regions of space which have a p-value less than some pre-defined limit will be considered regions that reject the null hypothesis.

Seemingly, one difference between this test and the likelihood-ratio test described above is that this p-value test doesn't appear to depend on the model of the alternative hypothesis.  We are only calculating the total probability of a certain space of data given the null hypothesis and making our hypothesis choice based on that.  Historically, this type of hypothesis testing that only considered the null hypothesis was supported by Fischer, where as the type of hypothesis testing that explicitly compared $H_0$ to $H_1$ was supported by Neyman and Pearson (hence the Lemma named after them).

# Scenario 2: Comparing two models given data


The case when there are only two possible models describing a phenomenon, where only one of which is true, is known as a "Simple Hypothesis".  Typically, these models are thought of asymmetrically: one model, known as the "Null Hypothesis" and here referred to as $H_0$, is thought of as the current understanding of the world and the other model, known as the "Alternate Hypothesis" and here referred to as $H_1$, is the challenger theory which, depending on the data, may unseat the null hypothesis.

The name "Simple Hypothesis" does not mean that the models corresponding to the two hypotheses themselves have to be "simple": The data being generated can be high dimensional and the models can have a complicated functional form.  The only requirement is that there only be 2 possible models and that those models have no free or unknown parameters.

This version of hypothesis testing ultimately boils down to considering the possible space of data and labeling certain regions of that space as supporting $H_0$ and other regions as supporting $H_1$ in a way that fully partitions the space.  If the data lands in a region of space that supports $H_0$, you maintain the null hypothesis and reject the alternate hypothesis.  Otherwise, you reject the null and support this alternate hypothesis.  There are a number of properties to consider when determining these partitions.

Any partitioning of the space can be considered in terms of the following:

- The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis GIVEN THAT the null hypothesis is actually true
- The probability of continuing to support the null hypothesis GIVEN THAT the alternative hypothesis is true

Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true is known as a "Type 1 Error", and the probability of a "Type 1 Error" often called the "size" of a hypothesis test.  The probability of accepting the alternative hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is indeed true is known as "power".  Intuitively, one would like to partition space in a way that minimizes the probability of a "Type 1 Error" and maximizes the power.  Note that the size of the test and power are determined by how one partitions the data space into $H_0$ and $H_1$ regions and not by the data itself.  These can be determined before you even run your experiment and observe the data, as long as you know what your two hypothesis are.

In this language, this process of testing a Simple Hypothesis is easy.  You can just partition the space however you choose, measure your data, pick $H_0$ or $H_1$ based on your partitioning, and then go home.  But, clearly, some partitioning must be better than others, so let's figure out what it means to be "better" and how to actually calculate those partitions that have the property of being "better".

The typical way to think about these properties and the constraints on the data space partitions that on draws is the following:

- Pick a fixed value for the size of the test (the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis GIVEN that it's true)
- Find the distribution of your data given $H_0$ and $H_1$.  Typically, this is done by calculating a single value representative of your data (a "summary statistic") and finding the probability distribution of that single-valued summary statistic given both hypotheses.  For high dimensional data, this is often easier to contemplate and visualize.
- Using those distributions, find the partitioning of the data space that maximizes the power of the test given the chosen size of the test.  This partitioning fully specifies the test.

Typically, people choose a size of the test to be 0.05 (5% chance of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis), or one of a few other well-rounded numbers.  From there, they strive to pick regions that have high power.

Fortunately, in the case of a Simple Hypothesis, there is a way to find a division of space between the null and alternate hypothesis that maximizes the power of the test for a fixed value of the size of the test.  This procedure can be proven, and the proof is called the Neymanâ€“Pearson Lemma.

The lemma simply states that on should parameterize the partitions of space by a single parameter, $\eta$, which is defined by:

$$
\frac {L(data | H_0)} {L(data | H_1)} <= \eta
$$

In other words, one should consider contours defined by the likelihood ratio of the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis.  Given those contours, the size of the test then fully determines the partitioning of the space: just pick the $H_0$ region such that the total probability of the region (given the null hypothesis) corresponds to the size of the test.

As far as things go in statistics, this is thus a solved problem.  If you are really in the case where you have only two possible models that could describe your problem, you should then delight.  However, that is rarely, if ever, the case.  Most problems have many possible models and each model has many parameters that are initially unknown, and this makes the problem of hypothesis testing much more challenging.

# Scenario 3: Finding values of a parameter that are consistent with data


Let's consider a more complicated scenario.  Instead of considering two discrete hypotheses, we consider a family of hypotheses parameterized by a single variable.  <!--Sometimes, in this case, it is instructive to consider a single value of this variable to represent the null hypothesis and for all other points to represent a family of alternative hypotheses.  Depending on the problem, there may not actually be a null hypothesis, in which case all values of the parameter can be considered on common grounds.-->  We imagine that we have a function representing a model which contains exactly one "free" or unknown parameter, and we further assume that SOME value of that parameter corresponds to the "true" model of our data.  We will refer to that value as the "true" value of the parameter (if our parameter is $\mu$, we will write it's true value as $\mu_{\text{true}}$).

The question we then want to answer is, "For a given measured dataset, what is the set of points of the parameter which are supported by the data (or, conversely, which points are rejected by the data)?"

The typical frequentist method for addressing this problem is by calculating what is known as a "Confidence Interval".  We will discuss what this means and how to calculate it in some detail.

Before doing so, I'll note that a confidence interval is only an example of one thing that a person *could* do when faced with this scenario; it is not be-all-and-end-all thing that **can** be done.  It is a procedure, motivate by statistical intuition, that can be a useful took when thinking about a problem or making a decision.  But how one chooses to use data or what one wants to calculate all depend on one's purposes, the level of rigor necessary, and one's philosophy.  For now, let's assume that calculating a confidence interval is what we'd like to do here.



## Confidence Interval Definition

Formally, a confidence interval is a procedure for calculating an interval in parameter space based on observed data that has a fixed probability of containing the "true" value of the parameter.  I emphasize that the interval is based on the data.  Because the data is based on a random distribution, then the interval itself is a random variable (different data would produce a different interval).  To a frequentist, the true value of a parameter is NOT a random variable: it is some fixed (but unknown) value.  Therefore, a frequentist does not talk about the probability that the true value is in some fixed interval.  Instead, they talk about the probability that an interval contains the true value.  For any fixed interval, it either DOES contain the true value or DOES NOT.

The probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of the parameter is known as the "size" of the interval, and is usually chosen in advance of calculating the interval.  For example, a 95% confidence interval will contain the true value of a parameter 95% of the time (depending on what observed data is generated by the model).

It isn't immediately clear how to translate the definition of a confidence interval into an actual calculation.  The definition is more of a description of the properties that an interval must have and not a prescription of how to create an interval with such properties.  Let's walk through how to actually translate this description into an actual interval.



## Brute Force Calculation

Calculating a confidence interval means coming up with a procedure that will contain the true value of the parameter some pre-determined percentage of the time.  There is only one single true value of the parameter, and so our procedure must produce an interval from data generated GIVEN that true value which contains that true value some pre-determined percentage of the time.  The trouble is that, since we don't KNOW that true value, we must ensure our procedure works for ALL possible values of the parameter, knowing that ANY of them could be the true value.  That's the challenge of a confidence interval.  While this seems initially foreboding, it turns out that it can be calculated using a relatively simple method which creates intervals having this property "by construction".

To me, the simplest way conceptually to calculate a confidence interval is using what I'll call the "brute force" method.  This method relies on generating many possible datasets for many possible values of the parameter of interest, which will be used to infer the distribution of our data for every possible parameter value (or as many as we need to satisfy our desired level of exactness).  We will first describe this procedure and then discuss why it creates confidence intervals (as defined above).

Let's label our data as $x$ and our single parameter as $\theta$, and assume that we want to generate a confidence interval of size $\alpha$.  Given that, the brute force procedure is as follows:


- For each value of our parameter $\theta$, generate many datasets.  For each value of $\theta $ , using the generated data, create a distribution $p(x | \theta)$ 

- For every value of $\theta$, choose a window in the domain of the data ($x \in [a, b]$) such that the total probability of that window is the size of the confidence window: $\int_a^b p(x | \theta) dx = \alpha$.  Record these windows $[a(\theta), b(\theta)]$ for each value of $\theta$.
- Run the experiment and measure the observed value of x
- Given that measured data, find all values of the parameter $\theta$ such that x falls in the window created above.  In other words, determine the set $\{\theta : a(\theta) < x < b(\theta)\}$.
- That set of values of $\theta$ forms the confidence interval on the parameter $\theta$ of size $\alpha$.
   
This procedure is known as the Neyman Construction.  The set of all points that fall in the union of each window for all values of the parameter is sometimes called the Confidence Band, as it traces out a 2-d sheet in parameter/data space.
   
Why does an interval, defined in this way, have the properties of the confidence interval that we desire (namely that it contains the true value of $\theta$ with probability $\alpha$)?

Well, we start with the statement that here is only one TRUE value of $\theta$.  It is unknown to the person performing the experiment, but it exists.  For that fixed value of $\theta$, there will be a distribution of $\x$ generated (and we will measure a single random variable from that distribution when we perform the experiment).  

By tautology, there is a 95% change that the value of $x$ that we draw will be in a 95% interval of the distribution of $x$ given $\theta_{\text{true}}$.  There are two cases to example:

- Case 1: Given $\theta_{\text{true}}$, the value of $x$ that we draw **IS** in that interval.  In this case, when the experimenter builds their confidence interval as described above, it will contain the true value of $\theta$, since $\theta_{\text{true}}$ will be one of the $\theta$ values whose 95% confidence window contains $x$
- Case 2: Given $\theta_{\text{true}}$, the value of $x$ that we draw **IS NOT** in that interval.  Therefore, by the same logic, the experimenter's confidence interval will NOT contain the true value of $\theta$, since the measured value of $x$ is outside of the 95% window of $x$ given $\theta$.

And, as described, we know that case 1 occurs 95% of the time and case 2 5% of the time.  Therefore, we have proven that a confidence interval, as described above, will have the properties that we desire.

There is one loose end remaining.  When picking the interval $[a, b]$ for a given value of $\theta$ GIVEN a distribution $p(x | \theta)$, we required that it must have a total probability of $\alpha$.  However, there are many ranges $[a, b]$ that contain that total probability (infinitely many for a continuous parameter).  Any choice of values of $[a, b]$ will create confidence intervals, as our proof above didn't depend on any choice of $[a, b]$.  So, would could then wonder, given a distribution, what particular range of $[a, b]$ should one choose (given that it must contain a total probability of $\alpha$).

To help inform the answer, the goal of a confidence interval is to give bounds that are useful in considering the true value of a parameter.  Intuitively, the smaller those bounds are, the more useful they are in constraining that parameter.  Therefore, one possible way of determining which intervals are valuable are those that are smallest.  It is relatively straight-forward to show that those intervals which contain the highest values of $p(x | \theta)$ will be the shortest (the higher the values of p(x | \theta) you choose, the fewer values of $\theta$ you must integrate over to obtain $\int_a^b p(x | \theta) dx = \alpha$).  As an alternative, one may choose to pick intervals that are symmetric around some value (though, this will not be possible in general).  One may also choose to start from $-\infty$ until the distribution integrates to $\alpha$.  There are many choices, and any particular choice should be considered in the context of the problem you are solving or the type of statistical statement you are trying to make.  The choice that one makes here is known as an "ordering rule", since it determines the order you move in through the space of data while accumulating points to determine the interval $[a, b]$.


The Neyman Procedure, as described above, is in many ways an extension of the Neyman-Pearson procedure of solving the Simple Hypothesis problem, as described above.  One can define similar properties to confidence intervals as on can to hypothesis tests:

- A "Type 1" error in the context of a confidence interval is when the confidence interval does not contain the true parameter.  From the definition of the confidence interval, it follows that the probability of a "Type 1" error is the "size" of the confidence interval, or $\alpha$.
- Power, however, doesn't have a direct analog in the context of Confidence Intervals, unless one fully specifies how a confidence interval is to be used to perform a hypothesis test.  This is because there is no single alternate hypothesis, but many different alternate models (one for every possible value of our parameter, $\theta$).  Any confidence interval will contain an infinite number of parameter values $\theta$ that are not equal to $\theta_{\text{true}}$.  So, in one sense, every confidence interval makes a "Type 2" error by including incorrect parameter values.  But, intuitively, confidence intervals that are thinner for many possible values of $\theta_{\text{true}}$ are "better", and one can interpret that as a loose analogy to "power".
(Power = Probability of not covering a false value of theta = 1-beta, via https://indico.cern.ch/event/117033/contributions/1327622/attachments/55727/80175/Cranmer_L3.pdf, slide 121)



Continuing with analogies from previous sections, a Confidence Interval can be thought of as the set of all parameter points that are not rejected when performing a p-value test on the model with that value of the parameter given the observed data.  In this sense, a confidence interval can be thought of as an "inverted hypothesis test".  The hypothesis test for a given parameter point is "2-sided", as we're open to more extreme values in either direction.  (For a 2-sided test, there is no "uniformly most powerful" test https://indico.cern.ch/event/117033/contributions/1327622/attachments/55727/80175/Cranmer_L3.pdf)

Let's show that this gives us the same procedure as described above.  Imagine that we measure a value of our data $x_0$ and we want to perform a p-value test on the model defined by $\theta$ using a threshold of $1-\alpha$.  We would reject the parameter point $\theta$ if the integral of the probability of $x$ over points more extreme than $x_0$ is less than $1-\alpha$.  This is the equivalent of asking, "Does the measured value $x_0$ fall inside a window of size $\alpha$" (assuming that window corresponds to the region of data that is not considered extreme)".  This region will correspond to the slice of the Confidence Band if the band is defined with an ordering principle that matches the definition of "extreme" used in the p-value test.

For example, if we create one-sided confidence intervals (starting from $-\infty$), that will be the equivalent of performing a 1-sided p-value test on all possible values of the parameter given some measured dataset.


## Analytic Calculation

In the above procedure, iterated over small steps in our parameter to create the confidence band in a "brute force" fashion.  However, for a small subset of problems, the confidence band can be calculated exactly because the probability distribution can be handled analytically.

Given a probability density function $p(x | \theta)$, the procedure for generating a confidence interval of size $\alpha$ is:

- Find $C_L(\theta)$ and $C_U(\theta)$ such that the probability of $C_L(\theta) < x < C_U(\theta)$ is equal to  $\alpha$. This is typically done by integrating over the known pdf $p(g | \theta)$.
- Invert this inequality to find: $x^{-1}(C_L(\alpha)) < \theta < x^{-1}(C_U(\alpha))$
- The confidence interval is then given by $[x^{-1}(C_L(\alpha)), x^{-1}(C_U(\alpha))]$.

The inversion above is made simpler when $C_L(\alpha)$ is independent of x.  

The gaussian distribution is an example of one for which analytic confidence intervals can be calculated.  This plus the fact that it commonly occurs in a wide range of problems makes it very useful and important to understand.

The pdf of the gaussian distribution is given by:

$$
pdf(x | \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\sigma^2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} 
$$

We here assume that $\sigma$ is known or "fixed".

We would like to build the confidence band for this distribution analytically.  Before we do so, we have to decide how we want to distribute the confidence interval, or our "ordering scheme".  Since this PDF is symmetric around $\mu$, it seems reasonable to choose confidence intervals that are centered around $\mu=x$.  This is also equivalent of picking confidence intervals of the minimum width (by including the highest-values of the likelihood first).

The first step is to, for every point $\mu$, find a window $[a, b]$ in x such that:

$$
\int_a^b gauss(x|\mu, \sigma) dx = \alpha
$$

Since we want the interval $[a, b]$ to be symmetric about $x=\mu$, we can re-write this as the following:

$$
\int_{\mu-\delta(x)}^{\mu+\delta(x)} gauss(x|\mu, \sigma) dx = \alpha
$$

In this case, the confidence interval, for a measured value of x, would go from $[x-\delta(x), x+\delta(x)]$.  We just need to solve for $\delta(x)$.  The solution comes from using the error function.  This example turns out to be simple because delta ends up being a constant, independent of the measured value of x (this can be understood since the underlying pdf as well as our confidence intervals are symmetric under translations of x and $\mu$).

This means that if you measure a value of x from a gaussian distribution, your confidence interval is given by:

$$
[x - \sqrt{2}erf^{-1}(\alpha)\sigma, x + \sqrt{2}erf^{-1}(\alpha)\sigma]
$$

(Note that this problem is concerned with a single measurement x that is gaussian distributed with mean $\mu$.  We will later talk about building confidence intervals for the mean from n measurements from a single gaussian distribution).

This is a remarkable result: It means that I can easily build confidence intervals for gaussian distributions, simply by consulting a look-up table or by using a computer.

## Test Statistics

One can generalize the above approach by considering what is known as a "test statistic".  A test statistic is a quantity that can be used in place of the data x in the above arguments.  One can simply re-run all of the above arguments with the replacement of $x -> f(x)$ with f being any function of the data.  Distributions of x will be replaced with distributions of f(x), and the rest of the statistical argument will remain the same.

However, a test statistic may also be a function of the parameter of interest, $\theta$.  We will here show how to generate confidence intervals using such a test statistic.  Consider the test statistic $t = t(x, \theta)$.  $t$ is a function of the data and of our parameter (note that it is not a probability distribution, it is an arbitrary function that evaluates to a real number).  How can we use this to generate confidence intervals?

The procedure we followed using the raw data was to:
- Consider each point in the parameter space, $\theta_0$
- Generate the distribution of the data at that point: $p(x | \theta_0)$
- Create an "acceptance region" of size $\alpha$ in that distribution
- Measure an experimental value of x
- The confidence interval is the set of all values of $\theta$ whose acceptance region contains the measured value x.

Using a test statistic, we can follow an analogous procedure:
- Consider each point in the parameter space, $\theta_0$
- Given the model and the value $\theta=\theta_0$, generate datasets of {x_1, x_2, ...x_n}.  Calculate {t(x_1, \theta_0), t(x_2, \theta_0), ...,  t(x_n, \theta_0)}.  Use this to generate the distribution $p(t(x, \theta_0) | \theta=\theta_0)$.
- OR, if one is lucky enough, use an analytic formula for the distribution of the test statistic (at evaluated with $\theta=\theta_0$).
- Using that distribution, pick an acceptance region of size $\alpha$ in the distribution of $t(x, \theta=\theta_0)$.  Do this for every value of $\theta$.
- Measure the data x
- For each value of $\theta$, calculate $t(x, \theta)$
- The confidence interval consists of all values of $\theta=\theta_0$ such that $t(x, \theta_0)$ is in the acceptance region.

This method requires obtaining a distribution for the test statistic evalauted at each point $\theta=\thteta_0$ GIVEN the assumption that the true value of $\theta$ is $\theta_0$.  The potentially confusing point here is that the test statistic itself varies at each test point $\theta_0$ (and therefore it's distribution may also vary as a function of $\theta$).  And, as a result, we must calculate the test statistic at every value in our parameter space to invert it.

But it's easy to show that this procedure does indeed generate confidence intervals.  There is one true value of theta, $\theta_{true$}.  We simply need to show thtat $\theta_{true}$ falls in our confidence region $\alpha$ of the time.  But, by construction, $t(x, \theta_{true})$ will fall in the acceptance region of $\theta=\theta_{true}$ a fraction of the time equal to $\alpha$.  Therefore, when we invert the acceptance region, $\theta=\theta_{true}$ will fall in our confidence interval at a rate of $\alpha$.

Thus, we can generalize our approach by considering test statistics that may depend on the parameter we are interested in.  This is valuable in part because we may be able to generate distributions of these test statistics easier than we can generate distributions of the draw data.  In addition, by varying them as a function of our parameter of interest, can can make confidence intervals that are more powerful (since the test statistic can be chosen for it's power for each value of $\theta_0$ separately).

As before, we can interpret this as performing a p-value at each point in the parameter space of $\theta$, and creating a confidence interval as the set of all points that are not rejected by that p-value test.  By using a test statistic, we can consider the distribution of a different value at each point in parameter space to perform this $p-value$ test.


## Approximations


As demonstrated above, confidence intervals for some models can be calculated exactly, as the model's pdf can be inverted analytically (or, at least the inversion can be arbitrarily approximated by a computer or a table).  However, this is not the case for what I presume is the majority of real-world problems.  Fortunately, there is a useful approximation that allows one to calculate approximate confidence intervals for a wide range of problems.

### Approximation via Central Limit Theorem

Consider the case of a compound pdf, which is defined as a probability distribution function that can be decomposed into a product of identical pdfs, that has a single unknown parameter: 

$$
p(\vec{x_1}, \vec{x_2}...\vec{x_n} | \theta) = \prod{n} pdf(\vec{x_i) | \theta)
$$

This pdf models $n$ independent draws from a single distribution and is very common in the real world.  Models of this form have a very useful property: As n gets large, the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$ is approximately normal.  Let's first discuss what it means and then show why it's useful for estimating confidence intervals.

The likelihood function, $L(x | \theta)$, is the above pdf but viewed as a function of the parameter $\theta$ (instead of as a function of the data).  The maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$, denoted as $\hat{\theta}$, is defined as the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood function $L(x | \theta)$.  Equivalently, $\hat{\theta}$ minimizes the negative log of the likelihood function, $-log(L(X | \theta))$.

The property that we'd like to take advantage of is that $\hat{\theta}$ has a gaussian distribution about the true value of $\theta$:

$$
pdf(\hat{\theta} | \theta) = gauss(\hat{\theta} | \theta, \sigma_\theta)
$$

with some variance $\sigma_\theta$.  The variance, as it turns out, is equal to one over a quantity called the Fischer Information of the PDF:

$$
pdf(\hat{\theta} | \theta) = gauss(\hat{\theta} | \theta, \frac{1}{FI(\theta)}).
$$

where 

$$
FI(x | \theta) = -\frac{(d^2L(x | \theta)}{d\theta^2}
$$

We will not prove this, but the proof essentially follows from the central limit theorem: The log likelihood is a sum of the logs of the individual likelihoods, each of which is an independent random variable.  The central limit theorem states that the sum of independent random variables is gaussian distributed.  The main thing to note is that, as n gets larger, the approximation becomes better.  So, for experiments with a large number of observations, this approximation becomes very useful.

This is valuable because we already have a way to exactly calculate confidence for gaussian distributions.  So, if the likelihood function is very close to a gaussian distribution, we can approximately calculate confidence intervals for the variable $\theta$.

Recall that the confidence interval for the mean parameter of a gaussian distribution is given by:

$$
[x - \sqrt{2}erf^{-1}(\alpha)\sigma, x + \sqrt{2}erf^{-1}(\alpha)\sigma]
$$

which we here replace with:
$$
[\hat{\theta} - \sqrt{2}erf^{-1}(\alpha)\frac{1}{FI(\theta)}, \hat{\theta} + \sqrt{2}erf^{-1}(\alpha)\frac{1}{FI(\theta)}]
$$.

If one has an analytic formula for the likelihood and if one has sufficient data to trust the gaussian approximation, one can take the derivatives of the likelihood, calculate the Fischer Information, and plug it into the above to obtain your confidence intervals.


### Approximation via Wilks Theorem


Often, however, one may not have an analytic formula for the likelihood function.  This is often the case when the likelihood is very complicated and is represented only as a function in a computer program.  One is able to calculate it for any input values of the data or the parameters, but one cannot write it down or readily take derivatives analytically.  Therefore, the above approximations will not work.

However, one can make use of another theorem which enables the calculation of approximate confidence intervals in the "asymptotic" case of a compound likelihood where n grows large.

Consider the likelihood of data of a single parameter, $L(x | \theta)$ (the data $x$ may be multi dimensional or arbitrarily complex).  As above, we define $\hat{\theta}$ as the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood function.  We now define the likelihood ratio as the following function:

$$
LR(\theta) = \frac {L(x | \theta)} {L(x | \hat{\theta}}
$$

It can be thought of as the ratio between the likelihood's maximum value and it's value at any point $\theta$.  

We will also defined the negative log likelihood ratio as:

$
nll(\theta) = -Log(\frac {L(x | \theta)} {L(x | \hat{\theta}})
$

In the case of a composite likelihood with large n, a result known as Wilks' Theorem tells us that the distribution of the $nll$ evaluated at the true (unknown) value of $\theta$ is distributed as a Chi-Squared distribution:

$$
p(nll(\theta_{\text{true}})) ~ \Xi_m^2(nll(\theta _{\text{true}}))
$$

where $m$, the number of free parameters, here is equal to 1 because $\theta$ is the only unknown parameter.  In other words, if you assume that some value of $\theta$ is true (say, $\theta_0$), use your model to generate data with the distribution $p(x | \theta_0)$, and calculate $nll(x | \theta_0)$ on each of those datasets, the values ${nll(x1 | \theta_0), nll(x2 | \theta_0)...}$ will be distributed as $\Xi^2_1$.  Note that this Chi-Squared distribution does NOT depend on the value of $\theta_0$ that we chose (this remarkable result is why Wilks theorem is useful).

Thus, we can use the function $nll(x, \theta)$ as a test statistic to generate confidence intervals on $\theta$.  The fact that the distribution of the test statistic $nll(x, \theta=\theta_0)$ under the assumption that $\theta=\theta_0$ doesn't depend on the value of $\theta_0$ makes calculating the confidence intervals easier ($nll(x, \theta)$ DOES depend on $\theta$, by construction, but it's distribution doesn't).  The procedure is therefore to:
- Calculate nll(x, \theta)
- Pick a value of $\alpha$
- Use the CDF of the chi-squared distribution to find the value of the nll such that $\int_0^{nll_{\text{critical}}p(nll)d(nll) = \alpha$
- Invert $nll(\theta) <  nll_{\text{critical}}$ to get all values of $\theta$ for which the probability of $nll(\theta) > \alpha$

These values of $\theta$ form the confidence region.  In this case, since we know that the distribution is $\Xi^2$, we know that the critical value of the nll for each value of $\alpha$.  For a 68.3% confidence interval, the critical value is 1/2.  Therefore, the bounds of the confidence region are those values of $\theta$ for which the log likelihood is half of its maximum value.  This is a useful trick if one does not haven a expression for the confidence interval: scan along the parameter of interest $\theta$, starting from $\hat{\theta}$, evaluating the log likelihood at each step.  When it drops to half of it's maximum value, that value of $\theta$ is the boundary of the confidence interval.

We can therefore calculate the Fischer Information from the likelihood and plug it into the above equation for $\sigma$, as well as 

If we were able to calculate $\sigma$ for a PDF, we could plug that into the above equation, setting $x \rightarrow \hat{theta}$ and obtain confidence intervals.  However, calculating $\sigma$ directly may be challenging (we haven't discussed how to do it).  Instead, however, there is a valuable trick:

If we assume that the likelihood function is gaussian, we can determine it's standard deviation by starting at the maximum value of the likelihood and 



A common and useful estimation of confidence intervals for a wide variety of problems is based on the fact that the  uses the likelihood function.  


  Instead, an approximate confidence interval is used.  One of the most common ways of approximating a confidence interval is the following procedure:


Imagine we have a pdf for data (either a single value or a vector) that is a function of a single parameter:

$$
pdf = pdf(\vec{x} | \theta)
$$

One can consider this pdf to be a function of $\theta$.  Interpreting a pdf as a function of it's parameters (as opposed to it's data) creates a Likelihood function.  One can maximize this function over the range of the parameter $\theta.  The value of $\theta$ that maximizes this function we will denote as $\hat{\theta}$, and the value of the pdf at $\hat{\theta}$ is $pdf_{max}$.  We can then Taylor expand our full pdf function as the following:

$$
pdf(\vec{x} | \theta) = pdf_{max} + pdf'(\vec{x}|\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{2}pdf''(\vec{x}|\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})^2 + ...
$$

where the derivative denoted by ' is taken in terms of $\theta$.  Since the pdf is maximized at $\hat{\theta}$, we know that the term linear in theta drops out and we get the following expression for the PDF:

$$
pdf(\vec{x} | \theta) = pdf_{max} + pdf'(\vec{x}|\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta}) + \frac{1}{2}pdf''(\vec{x}|\hat{\theta})(\theta - \hat{\theta})^2 + ...
$$
