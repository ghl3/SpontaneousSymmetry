  <h3>LendUp</h3>

  LendUp is a startup whose goal is to safely offer credit all who need it.
  We offer credit cards, installment loans, and single payment loans to those who qualify.
  I began work at the company in early 2013 as the Head of Risk and Analytics (I was the 11th employee on the team).
  My role was to design and implement our risk and underwriting program, which entailed
  collecting and processing datasets, designing and testing statistical models for estimating credit risk,
  and writing software to serve our models in production and to score them in applicants.
  I grew the team from just myself into fully staffed Data Science, Data Engineering, and Credit teams.
  As the team grew, I as an individual contributor focused on building our statistical models and designing the data pipelines and tools required to maintain them.

  <!--Throughout my time at LendUp, I have worked on many of different aspects of the company, including
  credit modeling, fraud mitigation, data pipelines, and internal tooling.-->

  <h3>CERN / ATLAS</h3>

  I earned my PhD at New York University where I worked on the ATLAS experiment,
  which is one of the two major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
  My research focused on performing precision measurements of the properties of Top Quarks,
  and in particular using advanced statistical techniques and technologies to
  build sophisticated models to model our data and achieve more accurate results.
  In addition, I was the primary maintainer and developer of a statistical modeling package
  written in C++.  Our framework make it easy for other researchers to build
  large, detailed models and to leverage modern inference techniques.
  And, as a member of the collaboration, I wrote software in C++ to identify collisions
  worthy of beineg saved and further resarched, which ran in production on the 10s of millions of events per second that the LHC produced.
  For a discussion of my research results, see <a href="/atlas">HERE</a>.
