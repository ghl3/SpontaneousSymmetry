    I'm a programmer, data scientist, physicist, a lover of
    technology, and a person who's fascinated by learning how almost
    anything works.

  <p>
    I work at <a href="https://www.LendUp.com">LendUp</a>, a startup whose goal is
    to safely extend credit to all who need it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I previously obtained a PhD in High Energy Experimental Particle Physics
    at from New York University, where I worked on the the <a href="http://atlas.ch/">ATLAS</a>
    experiment on the Large Hadron Collider at <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I was also a fellow at the <a href='http://insightdatascience.com/'>Insight Data Science Program</a>.

    Symmetries are all around us and shape our lives in ways few understand.
    On an aesthetic level, symmetries are considered beautiful and visually pleasing.
    But the mathematical concept of a symmetry goes much deeper than the familiar definition.
    In a deep, fundamental way, symmetries govern how the world works.
    They are the language of the most fundamental physical processes that we can describe.
