  <h1>Spontaneous Symmetry</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to my personal site, a place where I can share a bit about
    who I am, what I do, and my interests.

  <p>
    I'm a programmer, data scientist, a former scientist, a lover of
    technology, and a person who's fascinated by learning how almost
    anything works.

    So, why the name <i>Spontaneous Symmetry</i>?
    The term comes from a phenomenon that appears in may fields of physics known as <i>spontaneous symmetry breaking.</i>
    Symmetries are all around us and shape our lives in ways few understand.
    On an aesthetic level, symmetries are considered beautiful and visually pleasing.
    But the mathematical concept of a symmetry is much deeper than the familiar definition.
    On a fundamental level, symmetries govern how the world works.
    They are the language of the most fundamental physical processes that we can describe.
