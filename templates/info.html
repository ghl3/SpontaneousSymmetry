    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    I'm a data scientist and computer programmer, and I am currently the
    head of Risk and Analytics at <a href="http://www.LendUp.com">LendUp</a>, an
    online lending startup.  My job is to design, train, implement, and
    maintain our company's risk models, which use statistical modeling
    and machine learning to determine what credit products customers are
    eligible for.  In addition, my job is to study our comany's data and
    to use it answer questions about our customers, our business goals,
    and to drive product decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I attended the <a href='http://insightdatascience.com/'>Insight Data
      Science Fellows Program</a>, a selective and intensive two month
    course designed to cultivate analytic skills and help its students
    understand the many roles that a data scientist can play in a modern
    tech company.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a PhD in High Energy Experimental Particle Physics that I
    earned at from New York University.  As a graduate student, I worked
    on work on an experiment
    called <a href="http://atlas.ch/">ATLAS</a>, which works with the
    Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
    at <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</a>, an
    international laboratory located just outside Geneva.
    As a member of the ATLAS collaboration, I built software to generate
    complicated statistical models, thereby enabling my collaborators to
    better understand the huge datasets being produced by our
    experiment.
    A more detailed description of my graduate work can be found <a href="/work/atlas">here</a>.
