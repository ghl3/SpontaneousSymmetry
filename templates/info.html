  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
</div>

<p>
  I'm a data scientist and computer programmer, and I am currently the
  head of Risk and Analytics at <a href="http://www.LendUp.com">LendUp</a>, an
  online lending startup.  My job is to design, train, implement, and
  maintain our company's risk models, which use statistical modeling
  and machine learning to determine what credit products customers are
  eligible for.  In addition, my job is to study our comany's data and
  to use it answer questions about our customers, our business goals,
  and to drive product decisions.
</p>

<p>
  I attended the <a href='http://insightdatascience.com/'>Insight Data
  Science Fellows Program</a>, a selective and intensive two month
  course designed to cultivate analytic skills and help its students
  understand the many roles that a data scientist can play in a modern
  tech company.
</p>

</p>
  I have a PhD in High Energy Experimental Particle Physics that I
  earned at from New York University.  As a graduate student, I worked
  on work on an experiment
  called <a href="http://atlas.ch/">ATLAS</a>, which works with the
  Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
  at <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</a>, an
  international laboratory located just outside Geneva.
  As a member of the ATLAS collaboration, I built software to generate
  complicated statistical models, thereby enabling my collaborators to
  better understand the huge datasets being produced by our experiment.

<!--
<b>A minor clarification:</b>

<p>
  My full name is <i>George Herbert Lewis</i>.
  In a professional context, I usually go by <i>George</i>.
  Among close friends and family, I'm refered to as <i>Herbie</i>, which is derived from my middle name.
  If you're only aware of one of those, don't take it personally.
  I find it's a convenient way to separate my professional life from my personal life.
</p>
Cheers!
