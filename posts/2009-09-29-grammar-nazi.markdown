Is it bad that the best part of my week is reading [this column?](http://topics.blogs.nytimes.com/author/philip-b-corbett/)

I guess this is the result of growing up in a grammar-obsessed private school in Connecticut.

Also, please refrain from pointing out any of my own grammatical mistakes and calling me a hypocrite.  This is a blog, not the Times.  Jeez.
