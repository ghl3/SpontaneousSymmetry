Here's a quick puzzle:  
  
Imagine that you live in 4 dimensions and are playing with toothpicks and sticky tack.  Someone asks you to construct a 4-d cube out of the toothpicks (with the tack to hold them together at the corners).  
  
In 4-d, how many toothpicks do you need?  
  
How about in n-d?
