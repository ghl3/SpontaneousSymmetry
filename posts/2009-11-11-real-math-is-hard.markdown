At least for some people:

[Article](http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090430/NEWS/904300313)

Highlights from the article:_

TRURO — Voters narrowly approved one of four zoning amendments late Tuesday night at the annual town meeting. But town officials were still looking at the exact vote count on that article yesterday.

In a vote of 136 to 70, voters passed a new time limit on how quickly a cottage colony, cabin colony, motel or hotel can be converted to condominiums. The new limit requires that those properties be in operation for three years before being converted to condominiums.

...

The exact count of the vote — 136 to 70 —had town officials hitting their calculators yesterday. **The zoning measure needed a two-thirds vote to pass**. A calculation by town accountant Trudy Brazil indicated that **136 votes are two-thirds of 206 total votes**, said Town Clerk Cynthia Slade.

**Brazil said she used the calculation of .66 multiplied by 206 to obtain the number**.

But using .6666 — **a more accurate version of two-thirds** — the affirmative vote needed to be 137 instead of 136, according to an anonymous caller to town hall and to the Times.

Slade said that she called several of her colleagues to see how they calculate a two-thirds vote, and the answer varied widely. In Provincetown, Town Clerk Doug Johnstone uses .66. But Johnstone said he'd never had a close vote where it might matter._


Wow.


For the record:

.66 * 206 = 135.96
.666 * 206 = 137.196

and

.6666 * 206 = 137.32
